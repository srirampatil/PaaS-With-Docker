PaaS-With-Docker
================

A cloud computing course project

  Aim of the project is to minimize the delay in bringing up the servers and start working on actual application/product. User can simply submit an application binary with its configuration through command line interface or Web portal provided and our system deploys and runs the application.

  The project involves using containers instead of virtual machines for deploying  application on servers. We will be using Docker for configuring and managing containers.

  Docker provides nicely packaged software stacks that can easily be transferred, replicated and controlled ensuring high levels of portability. Docker containers have an extremely fast startup times that can facilitate a more flexible infrastructure, allowing greater latitude to respond to the needs of the moment - literally.
